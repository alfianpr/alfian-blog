    <p>Hi, I'm Alfian, a <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> programmer from Indonesia. I've worked with a sprawling collection of technologies over my decade (or so) of programming, ranging from Python to Clojure. I'm most passionate about developer tooling, text editors and languages.</p>

    <p>My free time is mainly occupied by my <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a> Clojure tooling, <a href="https://github.com/Olical/conjure">Conjure</a>. You'll find posts in this blog covering topics such as D3 and React integration as well as building Neovim RPC clients in Rust, it's quite eclectic.</p>

    <p>You can find ways to get in touch with me at the bottom of each page.</p>

    <p>I hope you find something useful here. Have a great day!</p>
